        <h3> what is vtol vr</h3>
            <img src="vtol vr logo (3).jpg" alt = "vtol vr logo">
            <p> vtol vr is a vr mil flight sim. it is imursive amd fun espaccially with freinds and is only devloped by one person</p>
    <h3>gameplay</h3>
        <p>vtol vr has amazing game play and shows how using vr can make a otherwise stale enviroment immursive,<br> vtol vr also is easy to learn but hard to master
             my only complaint with the game play is that the turtoials could be better<br>. multiplayer is also amazing its fun to fly and do missions with your freinds espaccially
            in the tandem aircraft </p>
        <h3>graphics</h3>
            <p> vtol vr has normal vr graphics not too good but it works for vr the gameplay is where its it</p>
            <h3>sound</h3>
            <p>vtol has 3 tracks in the built in mp3 player in the plane the tracks sound preetty good and go well with gameplay,<br> other than that there is no soundtrack</p>
        <h3>story</h3>
            <p>most aircraft except 2 have a plot in there campaighn the story is not rich but it does make it feel like all the missions are connected</p>
            <h3>overall</h3>
            <h4>10/10</h4>
            <p>in conclusion vtol vr is a amazing vr game is you are getting a headset for pcvr get vtol vr and a freind its the most fun you will ever have in your life</p>

                <P>vtol vr does not have many vehicles unlike simmuler games such as dcs world.<br>
                    however what vtol vr lakes in quanity it gains is simple enjoyment so starting in order of realase date
                    <br> here are you aircraft.
                </P>
            <h3>AV-42C</h3>
                <p>the AV-42C or (Attack Verticle 42C) is the first aircraft in the game and is one of the 3 vtol aircrafts out of the 5 in game </p>
