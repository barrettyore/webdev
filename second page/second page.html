        <h3> what is vtol vr</h3>
            <img src="vtol vr logo (3).jpg" alt = "vtol vr logo">
            <p> vtol vr is a vr mil flight sim. it is imursive amd fun espaccially with freinds and is only devloped by one person</p>
    <h3>gameplay</h3>
        <p>vtol vr has amazing game play and shows how using vr can make a otherwise stale enviroment immursive,<br> vtol vr also is easy to learn but hard to master
             my only complaint with the game play is that the turtoials could be better<br>. multiplayer is also amazing its fun to fly and do missions with your freinds espaccially
            in the tandem aircraft </p>
        <h3>graphics</h3>
            <p> vtol vr has normal vr graphics not too good but it works for vr the gameplay is where its it</p>
            <h3>sound</h3>
            <p>vtol has 3 tracks in the built in mp3 player in the plane the tracks sound preetty good and go well with gameplay,<br> other than that there is no soundtrack</p>
        <h3>story</h3>
            <p>most aircraft except 2 have a plot in there campaighn the story is not rich but it does make it feel like all the missions are connected</p>
            <h3>overall</h3>
            <h4>10/10</h4>
            <p>in conclusion vtol vr is a amazing vr game is you are getting a headset for pcvr get vtol vr and a freind its the most fun you will ever have in your life</p>

            <H1>vehicle reveiws</H1>
                <P>vtol vr does not have many vehicles unlike simmuler games such as dcs world.<br>
                    however what vtol vr lakes in quanity it gains is simple enjoyment so starting in order of realase date
                    <br> here are you aircraft.
                </P>
            <h3>AV-42C</h3>
                <h4>overveiw</h4>
                <p>the AV-42C or (Attack Verticle 42C) nicknamed the kestral is the first aircraft in the game and is one of the 3 vtol aircrafts out of the 5 in game</p>
                <img src = "AV42C_Profile1.jpg" alt = "av-42c picture" width="500" height="386">
                <h4>review</h4>
                <p>the av-42c is easy to fly and its "island" campaign is great for new players to start in<br>
                it is used in its own campaighn as well as the campaign of other vehicles as a crew transporter<br>
                it is also a great attack aircraft due to its optionoal gimble gun and quick vtol transiation
                <br> it vtol engines are the only engines in the game capable of full afterburner while in flight allowing the av-42 to have some thrust vectoring<br>
                the only downside of the av-42 is its lack of radar makes it no an ideal fighter. </p>
                <h4>real life inspireation</h4>
                <p>all aircraft in vtol vr are fictonial but take heavy inspireation from us millatairy aircraft<br>
                the av-42c is byfar the most ficional aircraft in the game but canned be summed up by saying...<br>
                the av-42c is the v-22 opsreay if it was a jumpjet and had more weapons systems</p>    
            <h3>FA-26B</h3>
                <h4>overveiw</h4>
                <p>the FA-26B or (Fighter Attack 42B) nicknamed the wasp might as well be the ANGEL OF DEATH
                    <br> the plane is huge as shown in the image below futureing the wasp being compared to the a320 the plane is not a vtol but did intradouce radar in the game
                </p>
                <img src = "fa26b size.jpg" alt = "fa26b size compharision">
                <img src = "fa26b.jpg" alt = "fa26b" width="400", height="286">
                <h4>reveiw</h4>
                <p>the fa26 is a angel of death its huge powerful twin engines<br>
                    and 14 hardpoints allow it to carry mulyiple hydras a gun cluster bombs and agm65,s with extra fuel while still keeping a twr above 1<br>
                    the wasps campaighn desert cobra is a excellent campaign starting from where the island left you off and quicly leading up to huge epic missions<br>
                    includeing the final mission witcSh is arguably the hardest mission in the game<br> where you take off from the carrier loaded with weapons fly over a peir while taking out sams do a small canyon run<br>
                    to come over a city take out more sams then do another canyon run then proceeding to pop out at the biggest millatairy base in the game 
                    as hinted by the name the fa26b is a fighter attack aircraft the aircraft was the first to include radar making it a excent fighter and the high carring capacity <br>
                    also makes it the perfect combo aircraft being able to carry aim missle,s and agm,s in good quanity
                </p>
                <h4>real life inspireation</h4>
                <p>as shown in the img below the fa26b is based off the f22,f18, and f15 the cockpit comes from the f22<br>
                while the mid section comes from the f15 and the engines come from the f18</p>
