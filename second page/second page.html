        <h3> what is vtol vr</h3>
            <img src="vtol vr logo (3).jpg" alt = "vtol vr logo">
            <p> vtol vr is a vr mil flight sim. it is imursive amd fun espaccially with freinds and is only devloped by one person</p>
    <h3>gameplay</h3>
        <p>vtol vr has amazing game play and shows how using vr can make a otherwise stale enviroment immursive,<br> vtol vr also is easy to learn but hard to master
             my only complaint with the game play is that the turtoials could be better<br>. multiplayer is also amazing its fun to fly and do missions with your freinds espaccially
            in the tandem aircraft </p>
        <h3>graphics</h3>
            <p> vtol vr has normal vr graphics not too good but it works for vr the gameplay is where its it</p>
            <h3>sound</h3>
            <p>vtol has 3 tracks in the built in mp3 player in the plane the tracks sound preetty good and go well with gameplay,<br> other than that there is no soundtrack</p>
        <h3>story</h3>
            <p>most aircraft except 2 have a plot in there campaighn the story is not rich but it does make it feel like all the missions are connected</p>
            <h3>overall</h3>
            <h4>10/10</h4>
            <p>in conclusion vtol vr is a amazing vr game is you are getting a headset for pcvr get vtol vr and a freind its the most fun you will ever have in your life</p>

            <H1>vehicle reveiws</H1>
                <P>vtol vr does not have many vehicles unlike simmuler games such as dcs world.<br>
                    however what vtol vr lakes in quanity it gains is simple enjoyment so starting in order of realase date
                    <br> here are you aircraft.
                </P>
            <h3>AV-42C</h3>
                <h4>overveiw</h4>
                <p>the AV-42C or (Attack Verticle 42C) nicknamed the kestral is the first aircraft in the game and is one of the 3 vtol aircrafts out of the 5 in game</p>
                <img src = "AV42C_Profile1.jpg" alt = "av-42c picture" width="500" height="386">
                <h4>review</h4>
                <p>the av-42c is easy to fly and its "island" campaign is great for new players to start in<br>
                it is used in its own campaighn as well as the campaign of other vehicles as a crew transporter<br>
                it is also a great attack aircraft due to its optionoal gimble gun and quick vtol transiation
                <br> it vtol engines are the only engines in the game capable of full afterburner while in flight allowing the av-42 to have some thrust vectoring<br>
                the only downside of the av-42 is its lack of radar makes it no an ideal fighter. </p>
                <h4>real life inspireation</h4>
                <p>all aircraft in vtol vr are fictonial but take heavy inspireation from us millatairy aircraft<br>
                the av-42c is byfar the most ficional aircraft in the game but canned be summed up by saying...<br>
                the av-42c is the v-22 opsreay if it was a jumpjet and had more weapons systems</p>    
                <img src = "v22.jpg" alt = "v-22">
            <h3>FA-26B</h3>
                <h4>overveiw</h4>
                <p>the FA-26B or (Fighter Attack 42B) nicknamed the wasp might as well be the ANGEL OF DEATH
                    <br> the plane is huge as shown in the image below futureing the wasp being compared to the a320 the plane is not a vtol but did intradouce radar in the game
                </p>
                <img src = "fa26b size.jpg" alt = "fa26b size compharision">
                <img src = "fa26b.jpg" alt = "fa26b" width="400", height="286">
                <h4>reveiw</h4>
                <p>the fa26 is a angel of death its huge powerful twin engines<br>
                    and 14 hardpoints allow it to carry mulyiple hydras a gun cluster bombs and agm65,s with extra fuel while still keeping a twr above 1<br>
                    the wasps campaighn desert cobra is a excellent campaign starting from where the island left you off and quicly leading up to huge epic missions<br>
                    includeing the final mission witcSh is arguably the hardest mission in the game<br> where you take off from the carrier loaded with weapons fly over a peir while taking out sams do a small canyon run<br>
                    to come over a city take out more sams then do another canyon run then proceeding to pop out at the biggest millatairy base in the game 
                    as hinted by the name the fa26b is a fighter attack aircraft the aircraft was the first to include radar making it a excent fighter and the high carring capacity <br>
                    also makes it the perfect combo aircraft being able to carry aim missle,s and agm,s in good quanity
                </p>
                <h4>real life inspireation</h4>
                <p>as shown in the img below the fa26b is based off the f22,f18, and f15 the cockpit comes from the f22<br>
                while the mid section comes from the f15 and the engines come from the f18</p>
                <img src = "fa26b inspiration.jpg" alt = "fa26b inspiration">
            <h3>F-45</h3>
                <h4>overveiw</h4>
                <P>the f-45 or (fighter 45) nicknamed the ghost is the second to smallest aircraft in the game but is certainlty the most advanced<br>
                the plane added stelth mechanics into the game the plane is also the 2nd out of the 3 vtol aircraft in the game</P>
                <img src = "f45vtol.jpg">
                <img src = "f45flight.jpg">
                <h4>reveiw</h4>
                <P>the f-45 is the hardest jet to fly in the game but has a high reward the ghosts stelth capabillitys make it a excellent fighter
                    <br> for it is able to infratrate farther into enemy terratory without being scene<br>
                    the aircraft also has a advanced hud display as shown below
                </P>
                <img src="f-45hud.png" alt = "f-45hud">
                <P> the hud uses the RWR(radar warning reciver) to track other aircraft,missles,groundtargets,etc the hud is also head mounted meaning no matter witch direction you look you will always see this infomation
                    the aircraft only has one mfcd and is in a tablet format as shown below
                </P>
                <img src = "f-45screen.jpg" alt = f-45screen width="500" height="300">
                <p>the tablet format allows the pilot to show almost evry screen they would need at sized that makes sence<br> in other aircraft you would have to constanly switch between nav tpg radar etc<br>
                     the 45 allows you to have you css,rwr,radar,tsd,display,comms,etc all on the same screen<br>
                    the ghost also has a tsd or TATICAL SITUATION DISPLAY shown below</p>
                <img src = "f45tsd.jpg" alt = "f45tsd" height="400",width="400">
                <p>the tsd shows aircraft and other targets but also provides datalink all aircraft have some vesion of datalink evry other aircraft will share radar and tpg targets to every other aircraft in game<br>
                     the f-45 will share radar and tpg info with evry other aircraft however the f-45 will share rwr and tsd infomation with other f-45s allowing all f-45s in mp or sp to see other aircraft and targets that they wouldnt see otherwise<br>
                      paried with the advanced hud this makes the 45 a power house in air to air combat<br>inconclusion the f-45 does not have a campaighn of its own only a couple of quck missions<Br>
                    how ever in multiplayer and the fa26b campaighn the f45 is used to go in and take out enemy aircraft providing support and clearing the path for attack vehicles such as the fa-26b or av-42c</p>
                <h4>real life inspiration</h4>
                <p>the f-45 is an obvious f-35 with canards instead of elevons the name is pratically the same the vtol system is the same as the 35 and both aircraft have the same tablet stlye mfcd</p>
                <img src = "f-45vsf-35.jpg" alt = "f45 vs f35">
            <h3>ah-94</h3>
                <h4>overveiw</h4>
                <p>the ah-94 or (attack helicopter 94) nicknamed the dragon fly is the first dlc aircraft in the game<br>
                    its also the only helicopter and the 3rd out of the three vtol aircraft its also the first out of 2 tandem aircraft in the game</p>
                <img src = "AH-94_Landed.jpg" alt = "ah-94 on ground">
                <img src = "ah-94flight.jpg" alt = "ah-94 flight" width="640" height="360">
                <h4>reveiw</h4>
                <p>the ah-94 is the hardest aircraft to fly its funcions such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>head following canyon</li>
                    <li>over 100 hydra carring capacity</li>
                    <li>over 50 amg27 carring capacity</li>
                    <li>optinoal 20mm or 30mm chain gun</li>
                    <li>ground radar</li>
                    <li>8 agm114</li>
                    <li>tads sytem</li>
                    <li>tandem gunner and pilot setup</li>
                </ul>
                <p>makes the ah94 an excellent attack vehicle the head tracking cannon allows the pilot or gunner<br>
                just to look at targets on the ground and fire its even more powerful when used with the tpg head mode enabled<br>
                the dragon fly also has a openinoal radar with two modes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ground radar</li>
                    <li>air radar</li>
                </ul>
                <p>air radar is the same as radar in evry other aircraft however the ground radar allows the pilots of the ah-94 to see evry ground targets and will be the primary mode for the ah-94<br>
                the ah94,s radar is also optinonally equiped the radar when equiped is a seprite disk sitting on top of the rotor as shown in the begging of this section combined with datalink<br>
                out of a squad of dragon flys a few can have radar and provide radar infomation to other helicopters the radar being mounted at the top of the rotor gives the ah-94 the abillity<br>
                to hover right below the top of a building or moutain with only the dish exposed makeing it so the helicopters body is protected while being able to see all air targets or ground targets
                the tandem setup allows the pilot to worry about the diffucult flight mechanics while the gunner will focus on ground targets<br>
                the ah94 is a excellent attack vehicle but its has only one drawback.
                <br> the ah94 has a big weekness towards enemy fighters the aircraft is slow makeing avoiding missles harder it is also only capable of carring 4 short range heat seeking missles<br>
                that are hard to aim and have week tracking<br>
                the ah94 also does not have a campaighn like the f45 the ah94 only has a couple of quick flight missions that will help with learning to flight and showing the abillity of the aircraft</p>
                <h4>real life inspireation</h4>
                <p>the ah-94 takes inspiration from the ah-64(apache) and a proprosed disighn from bell the 360 invectus </p>
                <img src = "360invictus.jpg" alt = "invectus">
                <img src = "ah64-31.jpg" alt = "ah64" height="200" width="200">
                <img src = "ah64side.jpg" alt = "ah64 side" height="250" width="500">
            <h3>t-55</h3>
                <h4>overveiw</h4>
                <p>the t-55 or (trainer 55) nicknamed the tyro is the second dlc aircraft and second out of the two tandem aircraft its also the only trainer aircraft <br>
                the t55 is also the smallest aircraft in the game as shown below being compared to the fa26</p>
                <img src ="T55_under.jpg" alt = "t55 under" height="336" width="600">
                <img src="t55 size.jpg" alt = "t55 size">
                <img src="t55flight.jpg" alt="t55flight1">
                <img src="t55flight2.jpg" alt="t55flight2">
                <h4>reveiw</h4>
                <p>the t55 is easy to fly and is disgined to train new players or freinds in multiplayer however the aircraft has some unentending diffuculties when flying<br>
                    when flying aircraft such as the fa26/f45/av-42c you have to strain the aircraft to stall it meanwhile in the t55 the aircraft is so underpowered that pulling<br>
                    a tight turn can put you in a tip stall the aircraft is so underpowered that the twr with no weapons and fully fueled is 0.99<br>
                    this adds to the challenge of the aircraft. you cannot fly the t55 carrying a large loud out or flying to rough meaning you have to fly effeceintly and not waste any weapons<br></p>
                <h5>training</h5>
                <p>the t55 is a good and fun way for a player to intradouce a freind into the game</p>
