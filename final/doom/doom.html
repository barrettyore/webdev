        REVIEW<br>
        in doom you play as a super soldier space marine on a martian base that has been invaded by hell  doom doesn't really have any story except for a text paragraph
         at the end of episodes doom gained popularity due to its game play loop where you run at break neck speeds around in a hell invaded facility shooting demons when 
         you run out of bullets use a chain saw or punch them in the face doom also has a power up the makes your bunches kill and obliterate demons in a single punch when 
         you kill demons the bodies get left on the floor showing you where you've already been by the blood trail if you kill a demon hard enough the disintegrate into blood
          the entire game is very gory witch also helped to its popularity due to the alternatives being child and family friendly games from Nintendo and Sega witch was very
           appealing to adults and teens

        INFLUENCE<br>
        doom practically gave birth to the fps genre and made major technological  strides in the pc world after doom id made quake witch
        was the first game to feature full 3d with actual 3d models and the ability to look up and down as traverse a 3d space with rooms
         on top of one another quake does not have the same legacy as doom due to it being more Erie and less rocking out to ac-dc style music
          while punching demons however quake did eventually lead to valves half life witch made the pc industry how it is today in conclusion 
          doom has a big legacy and player base to this day and gave birth to the fps genre witch is what founding the pc gaming industry
