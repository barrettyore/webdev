        REVIEW
            half life was the first game from at the time a unknown company named valve the game featured at the time impossible elements such as skelatol animation scripted sequences a connected map sophisticated ai etc as you play anything you do the  environment and enemy responds. in half life you play as a theoretical physicist gordan freeman working at black mesa witch was a big change at the time were you usually played as a super soldier and shot everything in sight this helped in the marketing a game play where the phrase run think shoot live was used through out the  game where the player had to solve puzzles and make tactically smart decisions to survive the game starts off with making it seem like a normal day where you ride a tram in to work and colleagues speak of how 
        uneventful the day is once your arrive you head to a test chamber where your helping test samples
        under a mass spec spectrometer after you insert the first sample the machine becomes unstable and opens a dimensional rift to the border world zen where hostile creatures come from the other side after the indecent the facility is falling apart and you have to escape the facility. through out the 
        game the developers made sure to make the game highly immersive by making it more realistic and personal featuring no cut scenes except for 2 in those 2 there is a reason for not having control over the gordan  and you still see the scenes through gordan’s eyes the game still holds up today and recently featured a update for its 25 year anniversary if the graphics look to old for your liking  a fan made remake of the game (black mesa) remastered the game by heavilly upgradeding the graphics/sound and level designs while not messing with the story black mesa is a great way to get into the half life franchise and it’s how i personally started
